# Face-Image-Processing-OpenCV
A computer vision project demonstrating face image preprocessing, enhancement, edge detection, feature extraction, and feature matching using Python and OpenCV. Includes brightness analysis, keypoint detection improvements, and visualized outputs for understanding facial details.
## Histogram Equalization for Image Enhancement

### Project Overview

This project explores Histogram Equalization, a powerful image processing technique that improves image contrast by redistributing pixel intensities. Low-contrast images often hide important details in dark or bright areas. Histogram equalization stretches these intensities, allowing features to pop out more visibly.

I applied this technique on a real dataset of images, comparing before and after results to showcase how contrast enhancement helps in better visual interpretation and potential downstream tasks like object recognition.

### Objectives

Enhance image visibility and clarity
Study effect of equalization on different types of images
Visualize image histograms before and after processing
Build a beginner-friendly reference for image enhancement

### What Youâ€™ll Learn

How pixel intensity distribution affects image quality
How histogram equalization transforms contrast
Practical use of OpenCV for image processing

### How It Works

Load image from dataset
Convert to grayscale if required
Apply histogram equalization
Compare histograms and visual outputs
Example result visualization included inside the notebook
